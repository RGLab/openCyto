\arguments{
\item{fr}{a \code{flowFrame} object}

\item{channel}{the channel from which the cytokine gate is constructed}

\item{filterId}{the name of the filter}

\item{num_peaks}{the number of peaks expected to see. This effectively removes
any peaks that are artifacts of smoothing}

\item{ref_peak}{After \code{num_peaks} are found, this argument provides the
index of the reference population from which a gate will be obtained. By
default, the peak farthest to the left is used.}

\item{strict}{\code{logical} when the actual number of peaks detected is less than \code{ref_peak}. 
an error is reported by default. But if \code{strict} is set to FALSE, then the reference peak will be reset to the peak of the far right.}

\item{tol}{the tolerance value}

\item{side}{On which side of the density do we want to gate the tail. Valid options are "left" or "right".}

\item{min}{a numeric value that sets the lower boundary for data filtering}

\item{max}{a numeric value that sets the upper boundary for data filtering}

\item{bias}{a numeric value that adds a constant to the calculated cutpoint(threshold). Default is 0.}

\item{x}{a \code{numeric} vector used as input data}

\item{method}{the method used to select the cutpoint. See details.}

first derivative of the kernel density estimate}

\code{'right'} (default) or \code{'left'}?}

\description{
These methods aim to set a one-dimensional gate (cutpoint) near the edge of a peak in 
the density specified by a channel of a \code{\linkS4class{flowFrame}} to isolate the tail population. 
They allow two approaches to do this, both beginning by obtaining a
smoothened kernel density estimate (KDE) of the original density and then utilizing either
its first or second derivative.

We determine a gating cutpoint using either the first or second derivative of
the kernel density estimate (KDE) of the \code{x}.
}
\details{
The default behavior of the first approach, specified by \code{method = "first_deriv"}, 
finds valleys in the first derivative of the KDE and uses the lowest such valley
to place the cutpoint on the steep right shoulder of the largest peak in the original density. 

The default behavior of the second approach, specified by \code{method = "second_deriv"},
is to find peaks in the second derivative of the KDE and use the largest such peak
to place the cutpoint at the point on the right shoulder of the largest
peak in the original density where it is most rapidly flattening (the first derivative is rapidly
growing less negative).

Both approaches can be significantly modified from defaults with a number of optional
arguments. The \code{num_peaks} argument specifes how many peaks should be found 
in the smoothened KDE and \code{ref_peak} specifies around which peak the gate's 
cutpoint should be placed (starting from the leftmost peak). Setting the \code{side}
argument to "left" modifies the procedure to put the cutpoint on the left side of the 
reference peak to isolate a left tail. The \code{max} and \code{min} arguments allow for 
pre-filtering extreme values in the channel of interest (keeping only observations with 
channel values less than max and/or more than min). The bandwidth used for kernel density
estimation can be proportionally scaled using \code{adjust} (e.g. \code{adjust = 0.5} will
use a bandwidth that is half of the default). This allows for tuning the level of
smoothing applied in the estimation.

Lastly, the \code{tol}, \code{auto_tol}, and \code{bias} arguments allow for adjustments
to be made to the cutpoint that would otherwise be returned. \code{tol} provides a tolerance value
that the absolute value of the KDE derivative at the cutpoint must be under. If the derivative 
at the original cutpoint is greater than \code{tol} in magnitude, the returned cutpoint will be the first point 
to the right of the original cutpoint (or to the left in the case of \code{side = "left"}) with corresponding 
derivative within \code{tol}. Thus in practice, a smaller value for \code{tol} effectively pushes the cutpoint
further down the shoulder of the peak towards the flat tail. \code{tol} is set to 0.01 by default
but setting \code{auto_tol = TRUE} will set the tolerance to a reasonable estimate of 
1\% of the maximum absolute value of the first derivative of the KDE. \code{tol} and
\code{auto_tol} are only used for \code{method = "first_deriv"}. Additionally, the \code{bias}
argument allows for directly shifting the returned cutpoint left or right.

It is also possible to pass additional arguments to control the calculation
of the derivative, which will have some effect on the resulting cutpoint determination,
but this should usually not be needed. By default the number of grid points for the derivative
calculation will be 10,000, but this can be changed with \code{num_points}. The default
bandwidth can also be directly adjusted with \code{bandwidth}, where the final value used
will be given by \code{adjust*bandwidth}

By default, we compute the first derivative of the kernel density estimate. 
Next, we determine the lowest valley from the derivative, which corresponds to the
density's mode for cytokines. We then contruct a gating cutpoint as the value
less than the tolerance value \code{tol} in magnitude and is also greater
than the lowest valley.

Alternatively, if the \code{method} is selected as \code{second_deriv}, we
select a cutpoint from the second derivative of the KDE. Specifically, we
choose the cutpoint as the largest peak of the second derivative of the KDE
density which is greater than the reference peak.
